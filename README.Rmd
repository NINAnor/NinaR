This is an R package that provides Rmarkdown templates and various practical functions for R users in NINA. NINA-employees, please contribute with R functions that you think would be useful to others. 

Currently, the package contains the functions:

* addAlpha
* addLogo
* add_logo
* checkWorkload
* grassConnect
* grassDailyPrecip
* grassDailyTemp
* grassMonthlyPrecip
* grassMonthlyTemp
* grassViewshed
* jensAnalysis
* mountFolders
* ninaBeamer
* ninaColors
* ninaLogoPalette
* ninaPalette
* ninaRapport
* ninaSlidy
* nina_colors
* postgreSQLConnect
* scale_color_nina
* scale_fill_nina
* tidyScandinavian

# NOTE!
Some grass functions might not work.

# To-do
The templates are superseeded by the new quarto_templates, see e.g. https://github.com/NINAnor/quarto_nina_report. The old ones will be removed from this package.

# Installation

Install from github.
```r
devtools::install_github("NINAnor/NinaR")
```
To enable a simple vignette of current graphic functions (and install the suggested knitr package), do instead:

```r
devtools::install_github("NINAnor/NinaR", build_vignettes = TRUE)

vignette("Nina-figures")
```

Alternatively, it might be a good idea not to use the network drive to store your R-packages. To switch to using a local folder, create a folder on C:/, for example C:/R-packages. Then let R know where you want to put your packages by going to Control panel -> User accounts -> Change my environment variables, and make or update the environmental variable "R_LIBS_USER" to say C:/R-packages. After a restart, R should now use this folder for package installation. This might solve installation issues with other packages as well.


To list all the available documentation:
```r
help(package="NinaR")
```


# Template usage
!Note that these templates have been superseeded by a quarto version at https://github.com/NINAnor/quarto_nina_report . These versions should however work, e.g. in an environment that lacks quarto, and resembles the < 2025 NINA report formats.

Once installed and using Rstudio, Nina templates appear in the `New file>Rmarkdown` menu. Alternatively, they could be retreived by 
```r 
rmarkdown::draft("title", template="nina_slidy", package="NinaR")
#and
rmarkdown::draft("title", template="nina_rapport", package="NinaR")
``` 
For further use, see the package rmarkdown, rticles or the templates themselves.
